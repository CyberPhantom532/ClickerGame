A Clicker game made at school. 
The game is still underdevelopment and uses a JSON database on the server-side, so excpect a few errors or bugs.

Features:
 - The game features a shop with navigation button on top.
 - A settings div with areas for automatically generated cheat codes
 - No favicon :(
 - Logs (under development but beta version relased)
 - A type of gambling where your chance to win is the fraction of the pot that you own (computer players)
 - Info and stats page (not regulary updated)
 - Terminal which is to add some fun to the game. As of this commit help does not work but try to figure stuff out yourself I'll fix as quick as possible.
